         <h1>TECHNOLOGY</h1>
         <div class="tech">Human civilization got evolved, as the time passed. But what really caused 
             evolving? It was ‘technology’. Curiosity lead human to have new innovative 
             ideas which were just an abstract. Even after lots of failures, with passion, 
             dedication & education, human transformed those abstract into real working bodies 
             which changed the standard/ the way of living of human. Human knowledge, skills, 
             technique, methods, processes lead to the production and evolvement of the technology. 
             The hunger lead to the advancement of technology. The technology is the result of 
             embedding knowledge of technique into a well-designed system. The evolving technology 
             made rapid changes to the civilization. The word evolve means either ‘upgrade’ or ‘update’. 
             As the people discover circular object to move heavy thing easily utilizing it in a 
             conventional cart, People tried to modify/update it to make it more reliable & efficient. 
             As the load and the human effort got higher, People upgraded those carts to vehicle by 
             implementing an engine which just vanished the human effort. People needed more time & money 
             to export their loads, so they updated their engine performance & efficiency which increased 
             the speed & fuel economy. People embedded multiple attachments to have a multi-operational vehicle. 
             Now, people were looking up for standard & comfort, so they build up high-performance luxurious vehicle 
             with better & beautiful design. Every vehicle today is an example of technology advancement, if we 
             compare it to past, but it can be outdated tomorrow. So, Technology changes as time changes either 
             gradually or slowly. The technology was about reducing human effort and maximizing the productivity, 
             but as the time changed, Technology were taken as an objective & competition. That somewhat manipulated 
             the reliability to destructivity. For e.g. the atomic age caused millions of people to die & made land 
             unsuitable for civilization. So, technology has both curse & boon and it depends upon how human utilize it.<br/><br/>
            Technology has great impact in socialization & development. The deveopment processes, more specifically the infrastructures
            are created or developed using heavy machines and computer devices followed by technology. People build technology and with technology, 
            build anything they want. Technology has changed the perspective of every people toward development. And the development bring radial changes 
            to the technology for evolution to better one. Technology and development 
            are proportionally binded to each other. One can't be done without another. We can't live with technology forever, since it has affected our life with
            drastic changes. Technology has affected individual humans by its both advantage and disadvantage. Some of the types of technology 
            and the way, they affect are given below:</div>

                         <h5>Information Technology</h5>
                         Information technology are all about the computers that can input, process, store & outputs the data. It has affected a lot
                         in human life. Compuers are multi-operational device, People can use it in any field. IT is an example of most moern technology. 
                         People can do complex calculations, edit photos/videos, render graphics, watch/listen music & videos, scientific researches etc. through IT.
                         IT provides knowledge about the usability & purpose of the computer system. IT has highly affected our daily lives by making our daily task simpler, efficient & productive.

                     <div class="network">
                        <h5>Network</h5>
                        Network is the connection of mulitple computers of an area for data sharing. Network of computers around the globe is called internet or international 
                        network. Network is the most important component after IT, Network are used for data sharing from one access point to another which are close or more than
                        Kilometer apart. Because of network, people are able to communicate with each other far apart from each other. Due to network, People can share their ideas, opinions, 
                        creating widely over the globe. Today people oftenly used network through their device for social networking, playing online games, watching 
                        videos and all other stuff. So, Network has affectd our daily lives by communication, entertainment, education etc.

                     <div class="energ">
                        <h5>Energy</h5>
                        Energy simply means power. Energy is the vital part for the development and continuing of the civilization. Energy is of Different type which are thermal enery, radiant enery, 
                        chemical energy, nuclear energy, electrical energy, sound energy, elastic energy, light energy, gravitation energy etc. But the most important energy is electrical energy Because
                         about all the technology, we have been using runs on electricity or electrical energy. To produce electrical energy, different technology 
                         is used like solar panel, nuclear reactor, combustion engine, thermal generator and wind turbine. So energy is much more needed in daily life than any other thing, so it affects our daily life too by
                          limiting our needs without it's presence.

                        <h5> Sensors</h5>
                        Sensors are modules that detect and records particular data of the surrounding and sends it to the electronic devices. 
                        Sensors are widely used in electronic devices, more pecifically smartphones. Some of the sensors being used in smartphones are proximity, 
                        gyroscope, camera, accelerometer, magnetomenter, microphone, pressure, touch switch etc. All of them has specific purpose. camera and microphone sensors are 
                        widely used sensor and are used to capture photos and record videos. They had affected our daily lives by storing special moments & memories permanently. They 
                        are widely used in autonomous researches.

                        <h5>Transports</h5>
                        Transports are the mean to travel. There are a lot of transportation mean which are Airways(Aeroplanes, Helicopters, Drones, Rockets, Gliders), 
                        Waterways(cruise Ships, boats, yachts, submarines, jet skies), roadways(rickshaws, motorcycles, scotter, trucks, busses, car, cycle), ropeways(cable-cars), 
                        railways(train) etc. By using the transportation, people can travel to any places they want. Different technology is being used in the hardwares of the 
                        transportation means which increases the economy, efficiency and performance. Transportation has made a great impact in daily life by making it easy to go to any 
                        place at lesser time and with lesser effort in compare to walk.

                         <h5>Science</h5>
                         Science is just an intellectual knowledge gained by systematic study of particular field. Everything is based upon science. The technology is one of them. The evolution of
                          technology started ever since the discovery and praticality of science behind the working mechanism of a device was found. Science can explain how the thing works and also can 
                          simulate & describe the consequences which could be practically. Different scientific technologies like hadron collider, telescope, quantum computer, particle accelerator etc. are used for research 
                          and to find better alternative technology. Science has affectd technology which ultimately affectd us in daily basis Because we use technology for entertainment, education & other multiple purposes.
